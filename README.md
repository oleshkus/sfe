# SFE (Simple File Encryptor)
A simple file encryptor with support for various encryption methods and salt hashing, styled like a PDA from the game STALKER.
## About project
- This project is my coursework that I've successfully passed in college.
- It was made using Delphi 12 and one library which I've found somewhere in the Internet.
- It won't be upgraded, fixed or changed. The reason is simple, I don't want to recall Delphi and all its stuff.
- I don't remember how to deploy the project, cause it was more than 2 years ago. <hr>
*If you want to use it - just download the release version.* <br>
*If you want to change/edit something - you're welcome, good luck in that.*

## Known issues:
- When selecting an input file, an error related to file access appears. From my observations, this is only a visual issue.
- Font display issues. The font shows through to anything outside the encryptor window.
